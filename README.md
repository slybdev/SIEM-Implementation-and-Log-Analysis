# üõ°Ô∏è SIEM Implementation & Log Analysis: Detection Lab

A complete hands-on lab where I built a virtual SOC environment from scratch using Wazuh and Splunk to analyze Windows 10 endpoint logs generated by attacker activities within an Active Directory domain.

---

## üéØ Objective

To implement a working SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution for log collection and analysis in a simulated enterprise network. This project focused on detecting malicious behavior using Sysmon and centralized logging.

---

## üß† Skills Learned

- Active Directory Configuration  
- SIEM Log Forwarding & Aggregation  
- Sysmon Deployment with Olaf config  
- Attack Simulation & Brute Force Detection  
- Splunk Dashboarding & Querying  
- Log Correlation & IOC Hunting  
- Traffic Analysis with Wireshark  
- Incident Timeline Reconstruction

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com)  
- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/)  
- [Sysmon + Olaf Config](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)  
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  
- [Windows Server & Windows 10 VMs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)

## üî¨ Walkthrough

### 1. üõ†Ô∏è Lab Setup

- Created AD domain on Windows Server  
- Joined Windows 10 machine to the domain  
- Installed Sysmon and configured Olaf Hartong‚Äôs ruleset  
- Forwarded logs using Wazuh Agent and Splunk Universal Forwarder

### 2. üîç Attack Simulation

- Performed brute force attacks on domain accounts using Kali  
- Detected failed logons (Event ID 4625) and successful logon (4624)

### 3. üìä SIEM Correlation

- Ingested logs into Splunk & Wazuh  
- Queried event IDs to reconstruct attacker behavior  
- Visualized attack timeline using Splunk dashboards

## üîê Key Findings

- Domain logon patterns showed lateral movement  
- Event ID correlation highlighted password spray attacks    
- Dashboards improved analyst visibility on endpoint activity  

---


## üó£Ô∏è Conclusion

This lab showed the power of endpoint visibility and SIEMs in identifying attacker behavior. Building this from scratch helped me understand what real-world SOC analysts face in detection engineering and log triage.
